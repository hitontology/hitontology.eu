The goal of this project is to develop a Health IT Ontology (HITO) that allows systematically describing application systems and software products in health IT.

Our motivation is that information management professionals have a strong need to share and compare knowledge about health IT in several situations.
These situations are, among others, to describe the components of a health information system as part of its strategic or operational management, to select a new software product, to learn about available evidence regarding an application, or to hire or train health IT specialists.

However, at the moment, health IT descriptions are not easily comparable.
Thus, based on these needs, our motivation is to develop a Health IT Ontology allowing a systematic description of application systems and software products within health information systems (HIS).
This will allow easier sharing of knowledge and experiences, support better cooperation when planning and operating HIS and allow evidence-based decision making in information management in health care.
